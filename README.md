### The Project

React was a main framework that has been used to build user interface in this project. React-router has provided me to generate new url paths to display each product and also the navigation pages. Data is provided from seperate json file and then rendered accordingly. On home page you can see first 4 highest priced products. On click of each item you will be directed to corresponding page of that individual product.

On Products page you can see whole list of products. There are buttons which enables user to sort the list of products by their price. There is also input field which provides a functionality of filtering products for user. You can simply type some keywords and then see if there are matching results from our product list.

## Challenges

In this project I've mastered my skills on react-router. At the beginning it was a little bit tricky to generate specific url's for each product but later on I figured out my own way and now its working perfectly fine. I also wanted to have next and previous buttons so user can navigate through products once they are in specific product page. To do so I came up with idea of using indexes of the products and that went perfectly well.

All in all in this project I've learned a lot, especially about react-router and it was definitely fun to discover new things along the way. You can check out the live version here : https://react-product-list.netlify.app/

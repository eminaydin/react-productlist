## General Info

In this project I have created a website with dummy data where I could display bunch of products to user. On the homepage user will see the top products. On the products page, user can see whole list of products and try to filter them by either typing some keywords or simply by sorting. If user clicks on the product, respective information will be displayed in another screen.

The project itself has plenty of tiny work to do. Therefore I had to pay a lot of attention to edge cases. At the end I am happy with the project and grateful for what I have learnt along the way!
